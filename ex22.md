**Ex 01: A Good First Program**
- `print()` Display text in console


**Ex 02: Comments And Pound Characters**
 - `#` Used to place comments throughout the code to help explain it further to readers

**Ex 03: Numbers And Math**
 - `+` plus
 - `-` minus
 - `/` slash
 - `*` asterisk
 - `%` percent
 - `<` less-than
 - `>` greater-than
 - `<=` less-than-equal
 - `>=` greater-than-equal
 - Learned about `%` modulo operation that calculates the remainder after division between two numbers

**Ex4: Variables And Names**
 - `_` in variable names is used a lot to put imaginary space between words
 - `floating point` are numbers with decimals
 - `=` assigns the value on the right to a variable on the left
 - `==` tests whether two things have the same value

**Ex5: More Variables And Printing**
 - `print(f...)` format string.
 - `{}` used inside of `print(f...)` to call out variables
 - The `f` before the `"` and the `{}` characters tells Python 3 "Hey, this string needs to be formatted. Put these variables in there"
 - `round()` lets you round floating point number

**Ex6: Strings And Text**
 - `.format()` can be used to format strings as well
 -
   ```
    hilarious = False
    joke_evaluation = "Isn't that joke so funny?! {}"
    print(joke_evaluation.format(hilarious))
    w = "This is the left side of..."
    e = "a string with a right side."
    print(w + e)
   ```

 - This is another way to define variables within a string. In line 2 we are creating a joke_evaluation variable and passing an undefined f string variable  and in line 4 we are printing joke_evaluation but passing the hilarious variable as the f string that goes inside of joke_evaluation
